## Center for Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems (CASOS)
My primary affiliation is with the <a href = "https://www.cmu.edu/casos-center/" target = "_blank">Center for Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems (CASOS)</a>. CASOS aims to address "complex real-world issues" through computational social science, focusing especially on techniques from network science, text mining, applied machine learning, and simulation. My graduate advisor Dr. Kathleen Carley is the director of the center. 

## Center for Informed Democracy and Social Cybersecurity (IDeaS)
I am also a <a href = "https://www.cmu.edu/ideas-social-cybersecurity/people/knight-fellows.html" target = "_blank">Knight Fellow</a> with the <a href = "https://www.cmu.edu/ideas-social-cybersecurity/", target = "_blank">Center for Informed Democracy and Social Cybersecurity (IDeaS)</a>.
