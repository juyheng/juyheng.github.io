## CASOS Summer Institute
For the last five summers (2019-2023), I have taught at the <a href = "https://www.cmu.edu/casos-center/events/summer-institute.html" target = "_blank">CASOS Summer Institute</a>. The CASOS SI is an annual summer school on computational social science and network science techniques that caters to graduate students, junior faculty, and professionals from industry and the government. I have specifically handled sessions on text analytics, applied machine learning, and online harms.

## Dynamic Network Analysis, Carnegie Mellon University
In the Spring of 2023, I was a Teaching Assistant for the graduate seminar on <a href = "https://www.cmu.edu/ideas-social-cybersecurity/courses/19-640.html" target = "_blank">Dynamic Network Analysis</a> at Carnegie Mellon University. Taught by my advisor Dr. Kathleen M. Carley, the course offers Master's and Ph.D. students a wide-ranging introduction to foundational concepts and key methods in network science, with a strong focus on high-dimensional and big data networks. 

## Critical Text Analytics, Ateneo de Manila University
In the Spring of 2022, I handled an online seminar on <a href = "https://www.notion.so/spirit-on-the-stairway/Seminar-in-Critical-Text-Analytics-I-2022-H1-98c6da392d874096a83ed1e366b456c6?pvs=4" target = "_blank">Critical Text Analytics</a> for graduate students in psychology at Ateneo de Manila University. This course discussed theoretical and methodological foundations for applying computational text analysis techniques to answer social scientific questions from a critical lens.
