Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Societal Computing at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am advised by Dr. Kathleen M. Carley at the <a href = "https://www.cmu.edu/casos-center" target = "_blank">Center for Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems (CASOS)</a> and am a Knight Fellow with the <a href = "https://www.cmu.edu/ideas-social-cybersecurity/index.html" target = "_blank">Center for Informed Democracy and Social Cybersecurity (IDeaS) </a>.

My research integrates social, cognitive, and political psychology with network science and machine learning to examine the narrative and network dynamics of online conflicts. I am also interested in critical and mixed methods approaches to computational social science more broadly. My work has been published in journals including Political Psychology, Journal of Social Issues, and Applied Network Science; and at conferences such as ICWSM, ASONAM, and WebSci. For my research, I've also received awards from the Asian Association of Social Psychology, the Psychological Association of the Philippines, and the Philippine Department of Science and Technology. I was also named ICWSM Best Reviewer for the last three consecutive years.

Born and raised in the Philippines, I hold degrees in psychology and mathematics from the Ateneo de Manila University. I've also done research as a postbachelor fellow at <a href = "https://www.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/statnlpgroup/members/" target = "_blank">Heidelberg University</a> and the <a href = "https://isw3.naist.jp/Research/cs-ubi-en.html" target = "_blank">Nara Institute of Science and Technology</a>, and served as a project scientist and policy analyst for civil society and national government.

Thanks for stopping by! If you're interested in reaching out, send me <a href = "mailto:juyheng@cs.cmu.edu" target = "_blank">an email</a>.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
