Hello! I am a computational social scientist interested in studying the narratives and networks of collective action. I earned my Ph.D. in Societal Computing at Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by Dr. Kathleen M. Carley at the <a href = "https://www.cmu.edu/casos-center" target = "_blank">Center for Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems (CASOS)</a> and was a Knight Fellow with the <a href = "https://www.cmu.edu/ideas-social-cybersecurity/index.html" target = "_blank">Center for Informed Democracy and Social Cybersecurity (IDeaS)</a>.

My research integrates social, cognitive, and political psychology with network science and machine learning to understand collective social phenomena in terms of complex **narrative systems of meaning** and **networked systems of people**. My doctoral thesis specifically focused on **online hate**, focusing on how online attacks against social groups propagated through communities and linked to offline violence. More broadly, I've been deeply interested in **critical and mixed methods in computational social science**, especially applied to **the Asia-Pacific and the Global South**. 

You can read my work in computational and social science journals including Social Media + Society, Political Psychology, and Applied Network Science; and at conferences such as ICWSM, ASONAM, and WebSci. For my research, I've received awards from SBP-BRIMS, the Asian Association of Social Psychology, the Psychological Association of the Philippines, and the Philippine Department of Science and Technology. I've also been named ICWSM Best Reviewer for the last three consecutive years, and I currently serve on the Editorial Board of the Journal of Social and Political Psychology.

Born and raised in the Philippines, I hold degrees in psychology and mathematics from the Ateneo de Manila University. I've spent time doing research as a postbachelor fellow at <a href = "https://www.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/statnlpgroup/members/" target = "_blank">Heidelberg University</a> and the <a href = "https://isw3.naist.jp/Research/cs-ubi-en.html" target = "_blank">Nara Institute of Science and Technology</a>, and served as a project scientist and policy analyst for civil society and the Philippine national government. 

Thanks for stopping by! If you're interested in reaching out, send me <a href = "mailto:juyheng@cs.cmu.edu" target = "_blank">an email</a>.
