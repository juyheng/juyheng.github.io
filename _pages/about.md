Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Societal Computing at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am advised by Dr. Kathleen M. Carley at the <a href = "https://www.cmu.edu/casos-center" target = "_blank">Center for Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems (CASOS)</a> and am a Knight Fellow with the <a href = "https://www.cmu.edu/ideas-social-cybersecurity/index.html" target = "_blank">Center for Informed Democracy and Social Cybersecurity (IDeaS)</a>.

My research integrates social, cognitive, and political psychology with network science and machine learning to understand the collective dynamics of online conflicts. My doctoral thesis has specifically focused on the narratives and networks of online hate: how systems of meaning and systems of people are constructed and manipulated to fuel attacks against social groups and identities. More broadly, I've been deeply interested in critical and mixed methods approaches to computational social science, especially applied to the Asia-Pacific and the Global South. 

You can read my work in computational and social science journals including Social Media + Society, Political Psychology, EPJ Data Science, and Applied Network Science; and at conferences such as ICWSM, ASONAM, WebSci, and SBP-BRIMS. For my research, I've received awards from the Asian Association of Social Psychology, the Psychological Association of the Philippines, and the Philippine Department of Science and Technology. I've also been named ICWSM Best Reviewer for the last three consecutive years.

Born and raised in the Philippines, I hold degrees in psychology and mathematics from the Ateneo de Manila University. I've spent time doing research as a postbachelor fellow at <a href = "https://www.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/statnlpgroup/members/" target = "_blank">Heidelberg University</a> and the <a href = "https://isw3.naist.jp/Research/cs-ubi-en.html" target = "_blank">Nara Institute of Science and Technology</a>, and served as a project scientist and policy analyst for civil society and the Philippine national government. 

Thanks for stopping by! If you're interested in reaching out, send me <a href = "mailto:juyheng@cs.cmu.edu" target = "_blank">an email</a>.
