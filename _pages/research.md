## Narratives and Networks of Online Hate
My doctoral thesis posits that online hate matters not only in terms of how much there is of it, but also specifically because of (a) the <b>social narratives</b> through which it attacks its targets, and (b) the <b>social networks</b> by which it spreads. Especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, I showed that narratives are critical for <a href = "https://doi.org/10.1007/s41109-021-00362-x" target = "_blank">understanding differences in online hate across social contexts</a>, and that narratives are <a href = "https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051221104749" target = "_blank">a key component of inorganic hate compaigns</a>. Similarly, I demonstrated that online hate communities feature an organizational signature that can be detected computationally, and that these structures can be <a href = "https://doi.org/10.1007/s42001-020-00087-4" target = "_blank">exploited by social bots</a>.
